## Linear Regression to predict MPG

### tools: RStudio 

Using RStudio, I was able to run some code to read in our data about the prototypes. I ran Linear Regression lm() analysis and the corresponding Summary Statistics of Linear Regression.

Essentially, 3 variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values, AWD, Spoiler Angle, & Vehicle Weight. 
Slope is actually 5.35e-11 but I'm not totally sure what that means. 

I would say that we aren't quite predicting the mpg in an easy way for people to understand with this model. The following Scatter Plot gives an idea of what I mean:
